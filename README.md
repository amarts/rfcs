# RFCs

This repository would be used as a place to capture our ideas around everything we do in kadalu, in public.

All discussions, updates to design, and documentation should depend on this repository's content.

## How to contribute?

Send your proposal as a PR in markdown format. We use fork and pull-request model for patch submissions.

Each idea would be different file, in corresponding directory. If you are not sure how to classify the idea, then place it in 'general/' directory.

## Directory structure

Each directory would be for different repositories or topics. For example 'kadalu/' would be for everything we do in https://github.com/kadalu/kadalu project, or possible improvements in storage for kubernetes.
